    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kaju Katli, also known as Kaju Barfi, is a classic Indian sweet made from cashew nuts and sugar syrup. Thin, diamond-shaped, and topped with silver leaf, it’s a symbol of luxury and celebration in Indian households.</p>
    <p>Its smooth, melt-in-the-mouth texture comes from finely ground cashews mixed into a soft dough, lightly flavored with cardamom or rose water. Simple yet indulgent, it’s often the first sweet gifted during Diwali and other festivals.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cashew nuts</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tsp ghee</li>
        <li>¼ tsp cardamom powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind cashew nuts into a fine powder (avoid over-grinding to prevent oil release).</li>
        <li>Make sugar syrup by boiling sugar and water until one-string consistency.</li>
        <li>Add cashew powder to syrup, mix on low flame until it forms a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer to greased surface, roll thin with a greased rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Cut into diamond shapes, cool, and store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
